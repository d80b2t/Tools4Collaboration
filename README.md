# Tools4Collaboration
A repository that keeps the 'living document' about the various software tools for collaboration that are available these days. 


## Purpose
This is just the directory which contains notes to some collaborative
software. Everyone has their own preferences, but I was just keen to
try and bring things together for a quick 'cheat sheet' to
see what's out there.
